    zapis.txt</br>
Configuration file:</br>

Organisms:</br>
    Collor assigned to organism is above the board</br>
Organisms spread randomly(human(X/2,Y/2)), number of organisms (including human) at the start cannot be greater than</br>
    number of given fields (X*Y), otherwise simulation won't run.
