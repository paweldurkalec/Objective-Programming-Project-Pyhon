    spiecies buttons - allows to choose organism which can be put on board
Save/read file:
    zapis.txt
Configuration file:
    config.txt
Organisms:
    Collor assigned to organism is above the board
Organisms spread randomly(human(X/2,Y/2)), number of organisms (including human) at the start cannot be greater than
    number of given fields (X*Y), otherwise simulation won't run.
